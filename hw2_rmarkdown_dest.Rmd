__Question 2a__

```{r} 
## solve equation 2x + 5y = 33 and x + 3y = 19
a<-matrix(c(1,2,3,5),nrow=2,ncol=2)
b<-matrix(c(19,33),nrow=2,ncol=1)
c<-solve(a,b)
c
```
__Question 2b__

```{r}
## create vector
vec<-c(1:100)
## find mean without mean function
total<-sum(vec)
numinvec<-length(vec)
meanofvec<-total/numinvec
meanofvec

mean(vec)
```

__Quesiton 2c__
```{r}
##install dplyr package
install.packages("dplyr", repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org')
```


__Question 3b__

```{r}
#create data frame with 2 rows

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
