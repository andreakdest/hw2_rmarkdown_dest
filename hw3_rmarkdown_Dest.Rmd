__Question 1__
```{r}
##function to calculate mean
meanfunction<-function(n)
{
  ##find total of values in n, removing all NA values
  total<-sum(n, na.rm = TRUE)
  #find number of values in n
  numinn<-length(n)
  ##find number of NA data points
  numofNAs<-sum(is.na(n))
  ##substract NA values from total number of values in n
  actualnuminn<-numinn-numofNAs
  ##find mean of n by dividing total by number of values in n
  total/actualnuminn
}
```


```{r}
#open data file
dat<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-01/key_crop_yields.csv", header= TRUE)
```

__Question 2__
```{r}
#find range of years in data
#use range function
rangeofdatyear<- range(dat$Year) 
#print range of data
rangeofdatyear
```

__Question 3__
```{r}
#calculate the mean of maize (tonnes per hectare)
meanofmaize<-meanfunction(dat$Maize)
meanofmaize

```

__Question 4__
```{r}
##save a file with  name "Entity"

```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
